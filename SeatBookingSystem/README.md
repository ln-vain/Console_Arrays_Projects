# Seat Booking System

This is a simple console application written in C#.  
The program simulates seat booking in airplane sectors using arrays.

## Features

- Displays available seats in each sector.
- Allows the user to book seats in a chosen sector.
- Updates available seats after each booking.
- Menu interface using console commands.

## How It Works

- There are 5 sectors with predefined seat counts.
- The user can:
  - Select a sector.
  - Enter the number of seats to book.
  - Exit the program.

If the sector number is invalid or there are not enough available seats, the program will show an error message.
